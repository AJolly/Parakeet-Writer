# Parakeet ASR Configuration File
# This configuration is optimized for the Parakeet model and avoids Whisper-specific settings

recording_options:
  recording_mode: "continuous"  # Perfect for hands-free operation - automatically records and transcribes continuously
  sample_rate: 16000  # Parakeet works well with 16kHz
  min_duration: 500  # Minimum recording duration in ms
  silence_duration: 800  # Increased to 1.2 seconds for better natural speech detection
  sound_device: null  # null = default device, or specify device index

model_options:
  use_api: false  # Set to true to use OpenAI API instead of local Parakeet
  
  # Common settings (safe for both Parakeet and API)
  common:
    language: null  # null = auto-detect, or specify language code
    initial_prompt: ""  # Optional prompt to guide transcription
    temperature: 0.0  # 0.0 = deterministic, higher = more creative
  
  # API settings (when use_api: true)
  api:
    model: "whisper-1"
    base_url: "https://api.openai.com/v1"
  
  # Local Parakeet settings - SAFE TO USE
  local:
    # Note: Parakeet-specific settings are handled in the transcription module
    # These Whisper settings are ignored when using Parakeet:
    model: "base"  # Ignored by Parakeet
    model_path: null  # Ignored by Parakeet
    device: "auto"  # Ignored by Parakeet (NeMo handles device selection)
    compute_type: "float16"  # Ignored by Parakeet
    condition_on_previous_text: false  # Ignored by Parakeet
    vad_filter: true  # Ignored by Parakeet

# Key bindings - SAFE TO MODIFY
key_bindings:
  activation_key: "ctrl+shift+space"  # This becomes your START/STOP toggle for the entire continuous session

# Post-processing options - SAFE TO MODIFY
post_processing:
  remove_trailing_period: false
  add_trailing_space: true
  remove_capitalization: false

# Misc options - SAFE TO MODIFY
misc:
  hide_status_window: false
  noise_on_completion: false  # Audio feedback when transcription completes

 We should change the recording indicator to indicate a difference between listening versus actually it actively hearing sound, i.e., that there's sound that's happening and that it's actually hearing that, because that's a important difference also. Let's remove the amount of padding, and let's also see what we can do to make sure that this doesn't stop recording just because it's transcribing. I don't know if that means we have to multithread it or what. No. Yeah, currently, in case you start talking and then stop and it starts transcribing, it'll lose audio. 

Furthermore, let's track Yeah. Like the place where we had clicked when we started talking versus ended talking. 


It's sending a lot of pretty empty audio to be transcribed. Maybe some sort of gate or cut off for the audio?

PARAKEET-WRITER
===============

A modification of Whisper-Writer that uses NVIDIA NeMo's Parakeet ASR model (V2) instead of OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription.

OVERVIEW
--------
Parakeet-Writer is a desktop speech-to-text application built upon the excellent Whisper-Writer project by savbell. This modified version replaces the Whisper speech recognition engine with NVIDIA's state-of-the-art Parakeet ASR model (V2) from the NeMo framework, providing enhanced transcription accuracy and performance.

The application maintains the core functionality of the original Whisper-Writer - real-time speech transcription with customizable hotkeys and recording modes - while leveraging the advanced capabilities of NVIDIA's Parakeet model.

WHAT'S NEW IN PARAKEET-WRITER
-----------------------------
- Replaced OpenAI Whisper with NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet ASR model (parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2)
- Added support for Parakeet-TDT-0.6B-V2 model (state-of-the-art accuracy)
- Included both desktop application and web interface options
- Created separate virtual environment setup for NeMo dependencies
- Added Gradio web interface for browser-based transcription
- Implemented client-server architecture for flexible deployment
- Enhanced audio processing with NeMo's optimized pipelines

KEY FEATURES
------------
- Real-time speech-to-text transcription using Parakeet models
- Multiple recording modes (continuous, voice activity detection, push-to-talk)
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Desktop GUI application (PyQt5-based)
- Web interface option (Gradio-based)
- High accuracy transcription with punctuation and capitalization
- Automatic text insertion into active applications
- Configurable audio settings and post-processing options

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS & SETTINGS COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------
⚠️ CRITICAL: Many settings from the original WhisperWriter will cause crashes if used with Parakeet-Writer.

UNSAFE SETTINGS (will cause crashes):
- Model selection/paths (use only Parakeet models)
- Compute type settings (int8/float16/float32)
- Device selection (handled automatically by NeMo)
- VAD filter settings
- Condition on previous text
- API-related settings (base_url, api_key)

SAFE SETTINGS (can be modified):
- Hotkey combinations (activation_key)
- Recording modes
- Audio device selection (sound_device)
- Post-processing options (remove_trailing_period, add_trailing_space)
- Recording duration and silence thresholds
- Writing key press delay
- Status window visibility

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
- Windows 11 (tested) or Windows 10
- Python 3.8 or higher
- NVIDIA GPU recommended (CPU support available but slower)
- At least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- 5GB+ free disk space for models and dependencies
- Microphone/audio input device

INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR WINDOWS 11
---------------------------------

1. INSTALL PYTHON
   Download and install Python 3.8+ from python.org
   Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation

2. CLONE OR DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT
   Download the Parakeet-Writer folder to your desired location

3. CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the Parakeet-Writer directory:
   
   python -m venv venv_parakeet
   venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate

4. INSTALL PYTORCH (GPU VERSION RECOMMENDED)
   For NVIDIA GPU:
   pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   
   For CPU only:
   pip install torch torchaudio

5. INSTALL CORE DEPENDENCIES
   pip install omegaconf hydra-core

6. INSTALL NEMO TOOLKIT
   pip install nemo-toolkit[asr]

7. INSTALL WHISPERWRITER DEPENDENCIES
   pip install PyQt5 pynput audioplayer sounddevice scipy

8. VERIFY INSTALLATION
   python -c "import nemo; print('NeMo installed successfully')"

RUNNING PARAKEET-WRITER
-----------------------

Option 1: Desktop Application
   1. Activate virtual environment: venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate
   2. Run: python run_whisperwriter_parakeet.py
   3. Configure settings (use safe settings only!)
   4. Press "Start" to begin listening
   5. Use your configured hotkey to start/stop transcription

Option 2: Web Interface
   1. Activate virtual environment: venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate
   2. Run: python run_gradio.py
   3. Open browser to http://localhost:7860
   4. Upload audio or use microphone for transcription

USAGE TIPS
----------
- First run will download the Parakeet model (may take several minutes)
- Start with default settings and modify only safe settings
- Use continuous recording mode for best experience
- Ensure microphone permissions are granted to Python
- For best accuracy, speak clearly with minimal background noise
- Test with the web interface first to verify setup

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
- If model download fails, check internet connection and try again
- For GPU issues, ensure NVIDIA drivers are up to date
- For permission errors, run as administrator
- Check that no other applications are blocking microphone access

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
The project consists of several key components:

- transcription_parakeet.py: Core NeMo integration and audio processing
- run_whisperwriter_parakeet.py: Main desktop application launcher
- parakeet_web.py: Gradio web interface implementation
- parakeet_server.py / parakeet_client.py: Client-server architecture
- config_parakeet.yaml: Safe default configuration settings

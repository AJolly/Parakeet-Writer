PARAKEET-WRITER
===============

A modification of WhisperWriter that uses NVIDIA NeMo's Parakeet ASR models instead of OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text transcription.

OVERVIEW
--------
Parakeet-Writer is a desktop speech-to-text application built upon the excellent WhisperWriter project by savbell. This modified version replaces the Whisper speech recognition engine with NVIDIA's state-of-the-art Parakeet ASR models from the NeMo framework, providing enhanced transcription accuracy and performance.

The application maintains the core functionality of the original WhisperWriter - real-time speech transcription with customizable hotkeys and recording modes - while leveraging the advanced capabilities of NVIDIA's Parakeet models.

WHAT'S NEW IN PARAKEET-WRITER
-----------------------------
‚Ä¢ Replaced OpenAI Whisper with NVIDIA NeMo Parakeet ASR models
‚Ä¢ Added support for Parakeet-TDT-0.6B model (state-of-the-art accuracy)
‚Ä¢ Included both desktop application and web interface options
‚Ä¢ Created separate virtual environment setup for NeMo dependencies
‚Ä¢ Added Gradio web interface for browser-based transcription
‚Ä¢ Implemented client-server architecture for flexible deployment
‚Ä¢ Enhanced audio processing with NeMo's optimized pipelines

KEY FEATURES
------------
‚Ä¢ Real-time speech-to-text transcription using Parakeet models
‚Ä¢ Multiple recording modes (continuous, voice activity detection, push-to-talk)
‚Ä¢ Customizable keyboard shortcuts
‚Ä¢ Desktop GUI application (PyQt5-based)
‚Ä¢ Web interface option (Gradio-based)
‚Ä¢ High accuracy transcription with punctuation and capitalization
‚Ä¢ Automatic text insertion into active applications
‚Ä¢ Configurable audio settings and post-processing options

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS & SETTINGS COMPATIBILITY
----------------------------------------------
‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Many settings from the original WhisperWriter will cause crashes if used with Parakeet-Writer.

UNSAFE SETTINGS (will cause crashes):
‚Ä¢ Model selection/paths (use only Parakeet models)
‚Ä¢ Compute type settings (int8/float16/float32)
‚Ä¢ Device selection (handled automatically by NeMo)
‚Ä¢ VAD filter settings
‚Ä¢ Condition on previous text
‚Ä¢ API-related settings (base_url, api_key)

SAFE SETTINGS (can be modified):
‚Ä¢ Hotkey combinations (activation_key)
‚Ä¢ Recording modes
‚Ä¢ Audio device selection (sound_device)
‚Ä¢ Post-processing options (remove_trailing_period, add_trailing_space)
‚Ä¢ Recording duration and silence thresholds
‚Ä¢ Writing key press delay
‚Ä¢ Status window visibility

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
‚Ä¢ Windows 11 (tested) or Windows 10
‚Ä¢ Python 3.8 or higher
‚Ä¢ NVIDIA GPU recommended (CPU support available but slower)
‚Ä¢ At least 4GB RAM (8GB+ recommended)
‚Ä¢ 5GB+ free disk space for models and dependencies
‚Ä¢ Microphone/audio input device

INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR WINDOWS 11
---------------------------------

1. INSTALL PYTHON
   Download and install Python 3.8+ from python.org
   Ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked during installation

2. CLONE OR DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT
   Download the Parakeet-Writer folder to your desired location

3. CREATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
   Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the Parakeet-Writer directory:
   
   python -m venv venv_parakeet
   venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate

4. INSTALL PYTORCH (GPU VERSION RECOMMENDED)
   For NVIDIA GPU:
   pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
   
   For CPU only:
   pip install torch torchaudio

5. INSTALL CORE DEPENDENCIES
   pip install omegaconf hydra-core

6. INSTALL NEMO TOOLKIT
   pip install nemo-toolkit[asr]

7. INSTALL WHISPERWRITER DEPENDENCIES
   pip install PyQt5 pynput audioplayer sounddevice scipy

8. VERIFY INSTALLATION
   python -c "import nemo; print('NeMo installed successfully')"

RUNNING PARAKEET-WRITER
-----------------------

Option 1: Desktop Application
   1. Activate virtual environment: venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate
   2. Run: python run_whisperwriter_parakeet.py
   3. Configure settings (use safe settings only!)
   4. Press "Start" to begin listening
   5. Use your configured hotkey to start/stop transcription

Option 2: Web Interface
   1. Activate virtual environment: venv_parakeet\Scripts\activate
   2. Run: python run_gradio.py
   3. Open browser to http://localhost:7860
   4. Upload audio or use microphone for transcription

USAGE TIPS
----------
‚Ä¢ First run will download the Parakeet model (may take several minutes)
‚Ä¢ Start with default settings and modify only safe settings
‚Ä¢ Use continuous recording mode for best experience
‚Ä¢ Ensure microphone permissions are granted to Python
‚Ä¢ For best accuracy, speak clearly with minimal background noise
‚Ä¢ Test with the web interface first to verify setup

TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------
‚Ä¢ If model download fails, check internet connection and try again
‚Ä¢ For GPU issues, ensure NVIDIA drivers are up to date
‚Ä¢ If transcription is slow, consider using CPU mode or smaller model
‚Ä¢ For permission errors, run as administrator
‚Ä¢ Check that no other applications are blocking microphone access
